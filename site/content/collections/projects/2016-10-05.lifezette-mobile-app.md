  The LifeZette Mobile App is a simple consumer of the WordPress API published from the company's main website. This project came together under a very short deadline, from commission to publication in the Apple App Store and Google Play store was two weeks.
  
  The app is built on the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) to reach both iOS and Android devices. The WordPress API was extended with additional custom endpoints and data structures to publish images, videos, and advertising content to the application.
